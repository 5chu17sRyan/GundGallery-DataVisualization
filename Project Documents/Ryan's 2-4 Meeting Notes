Successful
	Some sort of visualization released to the public
		Not just for gallery
	Connects to art of trees
	Get people excited for exhibition
		Released before the exhibition
		Released on website and promotion through social media
		Could be a part of the exhibition space

		Consider the widest possible audience

Want user to have raised awareness of climate change
	Help audience connect global climate crisis with the local community

Maybe augmented reality (Look into) Very promising but possibly limitated by the data we have

500ft space for education materials

Could we get academic articles on environmental artworks that could inform our work?

Equipment: Ipad, Smart TV, Projection (Wont work as well because lighting need to allow for reading of other education materials)

PROJECT NEEDS TO BE FLEXIBLE BECAUSE EXHIBIT IS STILL SUBJECT TO CHANGE

Having multiple concurrent users builds a sense of community.
