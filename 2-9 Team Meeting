AGENDA
	1. Requirements from Gund Gallery
	2. How we will come up with our own requirements
		a. Check out data visualizations

Shiny (rstudio) - https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/
	Simulation - https://marcus.shinyapps.io/bus_simulator/
	Environmental Map-based Data - https://udwq.shinyapps.io/lakeprofiledashboard/
	Dataset exploration - https://nardus.shinyapps.io/soilprofile/
           https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/movie-explorer.html
	Simple - https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/telephones-by-region.html
D3 - https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery
	Bubble Map - https://observablehq.com/@d3/bubble-map
Crossfilter - http://square.github.io/crossfilter/
These Shiny and D3 examples come with the code used to make them. So, if we want to use one of these frameworks, it will be relatively easy.

Tableau - https://public.tableau.com/en-us/gallery/?tab=viz-of-the-day&type=viz-of-the-day
	Simple, effective, and pretty static data-visualizations.

		b. What data we have and plan to have
			i. We think we only have raw data on diameter at breast height and species, everything else comes from formulas with the diameter and species as inputs.
	3. Establish meeting time this week to work on the requirements document and a meeting time to meet with Skon
